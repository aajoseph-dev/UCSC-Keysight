Below is an example of a test step in Python, using the OpenTAP framework, that verifies the output voltage of the EDU36311A Power Supply. This test step assumes that the instrument connection and basic setup are already completed as per the instrument declaration provided.

```python
from opentap import *
from .EDU36311APowerSupply import EDU36311APowerSupply

# Use the Display attribute to define how the test step should be presented to the user.
@attribute(Display("Verify Output Voltage", "Verifies the output voltage of the EDU36311A Power Supply.", "Power Supply Tests"))
class VerifyOutputVoltage(TestStep):
    # Add properties (name, value, C# type)
    Instrument = property(EDU36311APowerSupply, None).add_attribute(Display("Instrument", "The power supply instrument to use in the step.", "Resources"))
    ExpectedVoltage = property(float, 5.0).add_attribute(Display("Expected Voltage", "The expected voltage value to verify.", "Parameters"))
    Tolerance = property(float, 0.1).add_attribute(Display("Tolerance", "The acceptable tolerance for the voltage measurement.", "Parameters"))
    Channel = property(int, 1).add_attribute(Display("Channel", "The output channel to measure.", "Parameters"))

    def __init__(self):
        super(VerifyOutputVoltage, self).__init__() # The base class initializer must be invoked.

    def Run(self):
        super().Run() ## 3.0: Required for debugging to work.

        # Measure the voltage on the specified channel
        measured_voltage = self.Instrument.MeasureVoltage(self.Channel)
        self.log.Info(f"Measured Voltage: {measured_voltage} V")

        # Compare the measured voltage with the expected voltage within the specified tolerance
        if abs(measured_voltage - self.ExpectedVoltage) <= self.Tolerance:
            self.log.Info("The measured voltage is within the specified tolerance.")
            self.UpgradeVerdict(Verdict.Pass)
        else:
            self.log.Error("The measured voltage is outside the specified tolerance.")
            self.UpgradeVerdict(Verdict.Fail)
```

This test step includes properties for the instrument, the expected voltage, the tolerance, and the channel to measure. The `Run` method performs the voltage measurement and checks if it is within the specified tolerance. If the measurement is within the tolerance, the step passes; otherwise, it fails.
