Based on the context provided, I will create an OpenTAP plugin class for the E8663D generator that includes a subset of SCPI commands to apply an electronic short across the input of the electronic load (`INP:SHORt`). The plugin will also have the ability to query the short status.

Here's the Python code for the OpenTAP plugin class:

```python
import opentap
from opentap import *
from System import String

# Define the plugin class
@attribute(Display("E8663D Generator SCPI Control", "Plugin to control E8663D generator using SCPI commands", "SCPI"))
class E8663DGeneratorSCPIControl(TestStep):
    # Define properties required for the SCPI communication
    GPIBAddress = property(int, 1).add_attribute(Display("GPIB Address", "GPIB address of the E8663D Generator", "Communication", 1))

    def __init__(self):
        super(E8663DGeneratorSCPIControl, self).__init__()
        self.Name = "E8663D Generator SCPI Control"
        self.GPIBAddress = 1  # Default GPIB address

    def Run(self):
        super().Run()

        # Establish communication with the instrument
        instrument = Instrument("GPIB0::{}::INSTR".format(self.GPIBAddress))

        try:
            # Apply a short across the input
            instrument.Write("INP:SHOR ON")

            # Query the short status
            short_status = instrument.Query("INP:SHOR?")
            self.log.Info("Short Status: " + short_status)

            # Set verdict to Pass if all commands execute successfully
            self.UpgradeVerdict(Verdict.Pass)
        except Exception as e:
            self.log.Error("SCPI command error: " + str(e))
            self.UpgradeVerdict(Verdict.Fail)

# This class represents the instrument and handles SCPI communication.
class Instrument:
    def __init__(self, address):
        self.address = address
        self.log = Log.Create()

    def Write(self, command):
        # Placeholder for instrument write operation
        self.log.Info("SCPI Write: " + command)
        # Here, you would implement the actual communication with the instrument

    def Query(self, command):
        # Placeholder for instrument query operation
        self.log.Info("SCPI Query: " + command)
        # In a real implementation, this would return the actual response from the instrument
        # Mock responses for illustrative purposes
        if command == "INP:SHOR?":
            return "1"  # 1 indicates the input is shorted
        return "0"  # 0 indicates the input is not shorted

# Register the plugin with OpenTAP
OpenTap.TapPlugins.Add(E8663DGeneratorSCPIControl())
```

Please note that this code includes placeholders for the `Write` and `Query` methods of the `Instrument` class. In a real implementation, these methods should contain the necessary code to communicate with the instrument using GPIB or any other communication protocol supported by the device.

I have used mock responses for the `Query` method to illustrate how the plugin could work. You will need to implement the actual communication logic for your specific setup. The `Write` and `Query` methods should be replaced with the actual GPIB communication routines, which may involve using a GPIB library or interface that you have access to in your development environment.
