Based on your instructions, I'll generate a Python OpenTAP plugin class for controlling the E8663D generator's waveform memory skew and clear commands using SCPI. This class will be designed to send SCPI commands over GPIB.

Here's the Python code for the OpenTAP plugin class:

```python
import opentap
from opentap import *
import System
from System import String

@attribute(Display("E8663D Generator Waveform Memory Control", "Plugin to control E8663D generator waveform memory using SCPI commands", "SCPI"))
class E8663DWaveformMemoryControl(TestStep):
    GPIBAddress = property(int, 1).add_attribute(Display("GPIB Address", "GPIB address of the E8663D Generator", "Communication", 1))
    ReferenceWaveformNumber = property(int, 1).add_attribute(Display("Reference Waveform Number", "The reference waveform number to control", "Settings", 2))
    SkewTimeInSeconds = property(float, 0.0).add_attribute(Display("Skew Time", "Skew time in seconds", "Settings", 3))

    def __init__(self):
        super(E8663DWaveformMemoryControl, self).__init__()
        self.Name = "E8663D Generator Waveform Memory SCPI Control"
        self.GPIBAddress = 1  # Default GPIB address
        self.ReferenceWaveformNumber = 1  # Default reference waveform number

    def Run(self):
        super().Run()

        # Establish communication with the instrument
        instrument = Instrument("GPIB0::{}::INSTR".format(self.GPIBAddress))

        try:
            # Send SCPI commands to set and query the skew
            skew_command = ":WMEMory{}:SKEW {}".format(self.ReferenceWaveformNumber, self.SkewTimeInSeconds)
            instrument.Write(skew_command)

            skew_query = ":WMEMory{}:SKEW?".format(self.ReferenceWaveformNumber)
            skew_value = instrument.Query(skew_query)
            self.log.Info("Current Skew Setting: " + skew_value)

            # Send SCPI command to clear the reference waveform
            clear_command = ":WMEMory{}:CLEar".format(self.ReferenceWaveformNumber)
            instrument.Write(clear_command)

            # Set verdict to Pass if all commands execute successfully
            self.UpgradeVerdict(Verdict.Pass)
        except Exception as e:
            self.log.Error("SCPI command error: " + str(e))
            self.UpgradeVerdict(Verdict.Fail)

# This class represents the instrument and handles SCPI communication.
class Instrument:
    def __init__(self, address):
        self.address = address
        self.log = Log.Create()

    def Write(self, command):
        # Placeholder for instrument write operation
        self.log.Info("SCPI Write: " + command)
        # Implement actual communication with the instrument here

    def Query(self, command):
        # Placeholder for instrument query operation
        self.log.Info("SCPI Query: " + command)
        # Implement actual communication and return response from the instrument here
        # Mock response for illustrative purposes:
        return "0.0"  # Assume 0.0 seconds skew is currently set

# Register the plugin with OpenTAP
OpenTap.TapPlugins.Add(E8663DWaveformMemoryControl)
```

Please note the following points in the code:

- The GPIB communication is represented by placeholder methods (`Write` and `Query`) and should be implemented according to your specific communication library or method.
- The `Instrument` class in this example is a placeholder for real instrument communication. It contains methods to write commands to the instrument and to query the instrument for information.
- The `E8663DWaveformMemoryControl` class is the
