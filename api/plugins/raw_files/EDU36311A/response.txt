  ```

Solution

Based on the aforementioned requirements, I will be using Python to generate a test plugin. I will begin by creating a driver and then the functions that utilize the SCPI commands for testing batteries.

1. Create a driver

A driver is an OpenTAP container that holds all of the device commands required to interact with it. This can include basic commands like setting/querying device ID to complex SCPI command sequences that implement device functionality. A device can have multiple drivers depending on its complexity. The following script creates a power supply driver for the EDU36311A based on the provided parameters.

import clr

class EDU36311ADriver:
    def __init__(self, connection):
        self.connection = connection
        
    def display_enable(self,state):
        """
        Controls the display enable mode global.
        
        Type: remote command only
        
        Syntax:
           :DISPlay:ENABle {ON|OFF|1|0}
           :DISPlay:ENABle?"""
        if state == 'ON' or state == 'OFF' or state == '1' or state == '0':
            self.connection.send(':DISPlay:ENABle {}'.format(state))
            return True
        else:
            return False

2. Create a function to turn off the display

The following function allows you to turn off the display for an EDU36311A power supply.

def turn_display_off(self):
    """
    Turns off the display for an EDU36311A power supply
    """
    self.connection.display_enable('OFF')

3. Create a function to turn on the display

The following function allows you to turn on the display for an EDU36311A power supply.

def turn_display_on(self):
    """
    Turns on the display for an EDU36311A power supply
    """
    self.connection.display_enable('ON')

4. Documentation

It's critical to provide clear documentation for your functions and APIs so that other developers can use them without difficulty. Below is an example of how documentation for both functions can look in a module.

"""
Module description:

This is a test module created by XYZ Inc. for their battery testing  
project, which aims to automate various battery tests using OpenTAP.

Function 1:

turn_display_off(connection)

This function is used to turn off the display of the EDU36311A 
power supply when conducting battery testing.

Parameters:
connection - USB-B object representing communication with the device.

Returns:
True - if the operation was successful.
False - if the operation failed.

Function 2:

turn_display_on(connection)

This function is used to turn on the display of the EDU36311A 
power supply when conducting battery testing.

Parameters:
connection - USB-B object representing communication with the device.

Returns:
True - if the operation was successful.
False - if the operation failed.
"""

5. Example usage

Usage examples are essential to show users how your code can be used in practice. Here are some examples of how these two functions could be used in an actual test scenario.

import argparse

# Import your EDU36311ADriver instance here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    
    # Parse command line arguments here
    
    # Instantiate EDU36311ADriver here
    
    # Use driver instance here    
    connection.display_enable('OFF')
    print("Display turned off")
    
    connection.display_enable('ON')
    print("Display turned on")

Conclusion

With this tutorial, you learned how to use Python to create plugins for battery testing and test specific scenarios for a specific device (i.e., EDU36311A). OpenTAP provides developers with many drivers, libraries, and functionality that makes it easier to develop automated testing software quickly and efficiently.

If you want more information about plugin creation and additional features provided by OpenTAP, you can visit their official website and read their documentations. Thank you for reading until here, and happy coding!
