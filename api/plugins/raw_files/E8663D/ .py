Based on the provided context and instructions, I will create an OpenTAP plugin class for the E8663D generator that includes SCPI commands to control the device over GPIB. This class will allow applying an electronic short across the input of the electronic load and querying the short status.

Here's the Python code for the OpenTAP plugin class:

```python
import opentap
from opentap import *
import pythonnet
from pythonnet import set_runtime

# Assuming you have set up the .NET runtime already
# set_runtime('path_to_dotnet_runtime')

# Import necessary .NET APIs
import System
from System import String

# Define the plugin class
@attribute(Display("E8663D Generator SCPI Control", "Plugin to control E8663D generator using SCPI commands", "SCPI"))
class E8663DGeneratorSCPIControl(TestStep):
    # Define properties required for the SCPI communication
    GPIBAddress = property(int, 1).add_attribute(Display("GPIB Address", "GPIB address of the E8663D Generator", "Communication", 1))

    def __init__(self):
        super(E8663DGeneratorSCPIControl, self).__init__()
        self.Name = "E8663D Generator SCPI Control"
        self.GPIBAddress = 1  # Default GPIB address

    def Run(self):
        super().Run()

        # Establish communication with the instrument
        instrument = Instrument("GPIB0::{}::INSTR".format(self.GPIBAddress))

        try:
            # Apply a short across the input
            instrument.Write("INP:SHOR ON")

            # Query the short status
            short_status = instrument.Query("INP:SHOR?")
            self.log.Info("Short Status: " + short_status)

            # Set verdict to Pass if all commands execute successfully
            self.UpgradeVerdict(Verdict.Pass)
        except Exception as e:
            self.log.Error("SCPI command error: " + str(e))
            self.UpgradeVerdict(Verdict.Fail)

# This class represents the instrument and handles SCPI communication.
class Instrument:
    def __init__(self, address):
        self.address = address
        self.log = Log.Create()

    def Write(self, command):
        # Placeholder for instrument write operation
        self.log.Info("SCPI Write: " + command)
        # Here, you would implement the actual communication with the instrument

    def Query(self, command):
        # Placeholder for instrument query operation
        self.log.Info("SCPI Query: " + command)
        # In a real implementation, this would return the actual response from the instrument
        # Mock responses for illustrative purposes
        if command == "INP:SHOR?":
            return "1"  # 1 indicates the input is shorted
        return "0"  # 0 indicates the input is not shorted

# Register the plugin with OpenTAP
OpenTap.TapPlugins.Add(E8663DGeneratorSCPIControl())
```

Please note that this code includes placeholders for the `Write` and `Query` methods of the `Instrument` class. In a real implementation, these methods should contain the necessary code to communicate with the instrument using GPIB. You will need to replace these placeholders with the actual GPIB communication routines.

Since the instructions specify not to import `visa` or `pyvisa`, and the actual GPIB communication implementation is not provided, this code will not execute GPIB commands but is structured to illustrate how an OpenTAP plugin for the E8663D generator could be structured.
