Based on your request, I'll create a Python test step for signal integrity analysis using the E8363B Analyzer. This test step will utilize the SCPI commands provided in the context to perform the signal integrity analysis and get status information about the integrity signal.

First, we'll import the necessary modules and the `AnalyzerE8363B` class. Then we'll define a new test step class for the signal integrity analysis. Within this class, we'll implement methods to set the signal type, query the integrity signal condition, and enable the integrity signal.

Here is the Python code for the test step:

```python
from opentap import *
from .E8363BAnalyzer import AnalyzerE8363B

@attribute(Display("Signal Integrity Analysis", "Perform signal integrity analysis on the E8363B Analyzer.", "Network Analyzers"))
class SignalIntegrityAnalysis(TestStep):
    Instrument = property(AnalyzerE8363B, None).add_attribute(Display("Instrument", "The E8363B Analyzer to use in the step."))

    def __init__(self):
        super(SignalIntegrityAnalysis, self).__init__()
        self.log = OpenTap.Trace(self)
        self.Name = "Signal Integrity Analysis"

    def Run(self):
        super().Run()

        if self.Instrument is None:
            self.UpgradeVerdict(OpenTap.Verdict.Fail)
            self.log.Error("Instrument is not set.")
            return

        # Set the type of signal being measured to CLOCK or DATA as required
        self.Instrument.normalSCPI(":MEASURE:SINTEGRITY:SIGNAL CLOCK")  # or "DATA" based on the signal type

        # Query the integrity signal condition
        integrity_condition = self.Instrument.querySCPI(String, ":STATus:QUEStionable:INTegrity:SIGNal:CONDition?")

        # Enable the integrity signal (assuming we want to enable bit 0)
        self.Instrument.normalSCPI(":STATus:QUEStionable:INTegrity:SIGNal:ENABle 1")

        # Query the integrity signal event
        integrity_event = self.Instrument.querySCPI(String, ":STATus:QUEStionable:INTegrity:SIGNal:EVENt?")

        self.log.Info(f"Integrity Signal Condition: {integrity_condition}")
        self.log.Info(f"Integrity Signal Event: {integrity_event}")

        # Set verdict
        self.UpgradeVerdict(OpenTap.Verdict.Pass)
```

Please note that you will need to customize the `:MEASURE:SINTEGRITY:SIGNAL` command parameter ("CLOCK" or "DATA") based on the type of signal you are analyzing. Additionally, adjust the `:STATus:QUEStionable:INTegrity:SIGNal:ENABle` command with the appropriate integer value to enable the desired bits in the integrity signal condition register.

This code assumes that the `AnalyzerE8363B` class is available and correctly imports the `Scope` as an instrument, and that the methods `normalSCPI` and `querySCPI` are properly defined in the `AnalyzerE8363B` class for sending SCPI commands and querying the instrument.
