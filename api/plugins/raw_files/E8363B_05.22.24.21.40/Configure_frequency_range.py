To create a test step in Python that configures the frequency range on an E8363B Analyzer, we can define a new class that inherits from `TestStep`. This class will use the `AnalyzerE8363B` class methods to send the appropriate SCPI commands to the instrument.

```python
from opentap import *
from .E8363BAnalyzer import AnalyzerE8363B

@attribute(Display("Configure Frequency Range", "Configures the frequency range of the E8363B Analyzer", "Network Analyzers"))
class ConfigureFrequencyRange(TestStep):
    Instrument = property(AnalyzerE8363B, None) \
        .add_attribute(Display("Instrument", "The instrument to use in the step.", "Resources"))
    StartFrequency = property(float, 1e6) \
        .add_attribute(Display("Start Frequency (Hz)", "The start frequency for the measurement.", "Parameters"))
    StopFrequency = property(float, 1e9) \
        .add_attribute(Display("Stop Frequency (Hz)", "The stop frequency for the measurement.", "Parameters"))

    def __init__(self):
        super(ConfigureFrequencyRange, self).__init__()

    def Run(self):
        super().Run()

        # Configure the start and stop frequency
        self.Instrument.normalSCPI(f":SENS:FREQ:STAR {self.StartFrequency}")
        self.Instrument.normalSCPI(f":SENS:FREQ:STOP {self.StopFrequency}")

        # Optionally, you can check for operation complete
        self.Instrument.opc()

        # Set verdict
        self.UpgradeVerdict(Verdict.Pass)
```

This test step sets the start and stop frequencies for the frequency range of the E8363B Analyzer. The `Instrument` property is used to specify the instrument, and the `StartFrequency` and `StopFrequency` properties allow the user to set the desired frequency range. The `normalSCPI` method of the `AnalyzerE8363B` class is used to send the SCPI commands to the instrument, and the `opc` method is called to ensure that the operation is complete before proceeding.

Please note that the `normalSCPI` and `opc` methods are not standard SCPI commands but are defined within the `AnalyzerE8363B` class to send commands and wait for their completion, respectively.

The code assumes that the `AnalyzerE8363B` class has already been defined and imported correctly from the `.E8363BAnalyzer` module. The test step can then be used within an OpenTAP test plan to configure the frequency range of the E8363B Analyzer.
