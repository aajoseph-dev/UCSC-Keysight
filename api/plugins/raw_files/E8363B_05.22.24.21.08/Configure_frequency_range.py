Based on your requirements, here is a Python test step to configure the frequency range of the E8363B Analyzer within OpenTAP:

```python
from opentap import *
from .E8363BAnalyzer import AnalyzerE8363B

@attribute(Display("Configure Frequency Range", "Configures the frequency range of the E8363B Analyzer.", "Network Analyzers"))
class ConfigureFrequencyRangeStep(TestStep):
    Instrument = property(AnalyzerE8363B, None)\
        .add_attribute(Display("Instrument", "The Analyzer E8363B to use in the step.", "Resources"))
    StartFrequency = property(Double, 1e6)\
        .add_attribute(Display("Start Frequency (Hz)", "The start frequency in Hertz.", "Parameters"))
    StopFrequency = property(Double, 1e9)\
        .add_attribute(Display("Stop Frequency (Hz)", "The stop frequency in Hertz.", "Parameters"))

    def __init__(self):
        super(ConfigureFrequencyRangeStep, self).__init__() # The base class initializer must be invoked.

    def Run(self):
        super().Run() # Required for debugging to work.
        
        # Check if the instrument is set
        if self.Instrument is None:
            raise Exception("Instrument is not set. Please assign the Analyzer E8363B instrument to this test step.")
        
        # Configure frequency range on the instrument
        self.Instrument.set_frequency_range(self.StartFrequency, self.StopFrequency)
        
        # Log the new frequency range configuration
        self.Log.Info(f"Frequency range set to {self.StartFrequency} Hz - {self.StopFrequency} Hz")
        
        # Set verdict
        self.UpgradeVerdict(Verdict.Pass)
```

This custom test step `ConfigureFrequencyRangeStep` allows users to specify the `StartFrequency` and `StopFrequency` for the E8363B Analyzer. It utilizes the `set_frequency_range` method from the `AnalyzerE8363B` class to send the appropriate SCPI commands to the instrument. 

Make sure to save this code in a file with an appropriate name, such as `ConfigureFrequencyRangeStep.py`, and place it in the same package/directory where `AnalyzerE8363B` is located so it can be imported correctly. When using this test step, ensure that the AnalyzerE8363B instrument is assigned to the step before running it.

Please note that the provided instrument declaration example has been used to reference the necessary instrument methods. If the actual instrument class is different, make sure to adjust the property types and method calls accordingly.
