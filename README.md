## Automated Plugin Generation for OpenTAP using Generative AI

This repository contains an innovative solution leveraging Generative AI to automate plugin generation for OpenTAP, a leading test automation platform. Developed in collaboration with UCSC and Keysight Technologies, this project aims to streamline the process of creating plugins for OpenTAP, reducing development time and enhancing productivity.

### Key Features:
- **Generative AI Plugin Generator**: Utilizes cutting-edge Generative AI algorithms, powered by LLM Chat-GPT-3.5, to automatically generate plugin code based on user-defined specifications.
- **WPF * C#Interface**: The user-friendly WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) interface provides an intuitive environment for configuring plugin parameters and generating code.
- **Azure AI Search Integration**: Harnesses the power of Azure AI Search to enhance code generation accuracy and efficiency.
- **LangChain Support**: Integrates LangChain for multi-language support, enabling code generation in various programming languages.

### How it Works:
1. **Input Specifications**: Users provide input parameters and requirements for the desired plugin via the WPF interface.
2. **Generative AI Processing**: The system processes user inputs using Generative AI algorithms to generate code snippets tailored to the specifications.
3. **Code Generation**: Generated code snippets are assembled into complete plugin code structures in C#.
4. **Output & Integration**: Users can review and integrate the generated code directly into their OpenTAP projects, significantly reducing manual coding efforts.

### Get Started:
