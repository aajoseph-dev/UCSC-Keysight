Based on your request, I'll create a Python test step that verifies the output voltage of the EDU36311A Power Supply without importing visa or pyvisa, and utilizing the OpenTAP libraries and the SCPI commands to communicate with the instrument. Below is the example code for a test step that verifies the output voltage for a given channel:

```python
from opentap import *
from System import String
import numpy as np

# Define the Test Step using OpenTap attributes
@attribute(OpenTap.Display("Verify Output Voltage", "Verifies the output voltage of the EDU36311A Power Supply", "Power Supplies"))
class VerifyOutputVoltage(TestStep):
    # Add properties (name, value, C# type)
    Instrument = property(EDU36311APowerSupply, None).add_attribute(OpenTap.Display("Instrument", "The instrument to use in the step.", "Resources"))
    Channel = property(int, 1).add_attribute(OpenTap.Display("Channel", "The channel to verify the output voltage of.", "Parameters"))
    ExpectedVoltage = property(float, 0.0).add_attribute(OpenTap.Display("Expected Voltage", "The expected voltage level to verify.", "Parameters"))
    VoltageTolerance = property(float, 0.1).add_attribute(OpenTap.Display("Voltage Tolerance", "The tolerance for the voltage level.", "Parameters"))

    def __init__(self):
        super(VerifyOutputVoltage, self).__init__()

    def Run(self):
        super().Run()  # Required for debugging to work.
        
        # Measure the actual output voltage
        measured_voltage = self.Instrument.MeasureVoltage(self.Channel)
        
        # Calculate the absolute difference between the expected and measured voltages
        voltage_difference = np.abs(measured_voltage - self.ExpectedVoltage)
        
        # Check if the measured voltage is within the specified tolerance
        if voltage_difference <= self.VoltageTolerance:
            self.log.Info(f"Channel {self.Channel} voltage is within tolerance: {measured_voltage} V")
            self.UpgradeVerdict(OpenTap.Verdict.Pass)
        else:
            self.log.Error(f"Channel {self.Channel} voltage is out of tolerance: {measured_voltage} V (Expected: {self.ExpectedVoltage} V, Tolerance: {self.VoltageTolerance} V)")
            self.UpgradeVerdict(OpenTap.Verdict.Fail)
```

This code defines a test step that will measure the voltage on the specified channel of the EDU36311A Power Supply and compare it to an expected value within a given tolerance. If the measured voltage is within tolerance, the test step will pass; otherwise, it will fail.

Please note that this code assumes the existence of the `EDU36311APowerSupply` class provided in your example. It should be registered in OpenTAP, and the instrument should be properly connected and configured before running this test step.
